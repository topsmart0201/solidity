    # This is the deploy target for the native build (Linux and macOS)
    # which generates ZIPs per commit.  We are in agreement that
    # generating ZIPs per commit for the develop branch is probably
    # just noise, so we only run this deployment target on 'release'.
    #
    # Unlike the Appveyor GitHub Releases target, the support in TravisCI
    # seemingly doesn't provide a means for passing a description, tag, etc.
    # In practice, we are letting the Appveyor CI do all that stuff, and
    # then this deployment flow just seems to find that most recent tag,
    # and just add our Linux and macOS ZIPs into the same tag, which is
    # what we want to happen.  But is very accidental and brittle-looking.
    #
    # The 'skip_cleanup' stops the workspace being cleaned out prior to
    # generation of the artifacts.  Strange that we should explicitly
    # need to do that, but we do.

    # Tokens in TravisCI can be generated a few different ways.  Bob had
    # success using the 'travis' gem, and then using that gem to
    # create/edit this .travis.yml file, and then cut-and-pasting the
    # good bits back out of what it generated.  The gem changes all the
    # whitespace and deletes comments, so cannot be used as-is.  But
    # it does generate an appropriate auth token.
    #
    # TODO - I do not know if the api_key below which work correctly
    # for ethereum/solidity.   I suspect not, for the same reason as
    # my auth token does not work for Appveyor.  I don't have enough
    # permissions to enable this myself.  Christian should be able to.
