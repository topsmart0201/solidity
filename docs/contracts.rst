Contracts
##########

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. They
contain persistent data in state variables and functions that can modify these
variables. Calling a function on a different contract (instance) will perform
an EVM function call and thus switch the context such that state variables are
inaccessible.

******************
Function Modifiers
******************

Modifiers can be used to easily change the behaviour of functions.  For example,
they can automatically check a condition prior to executing the function. Modifiers are
inheritable properties of contracts and may be overridden by derived contracts.

::

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

    contract owned {
        constructor() public { owner = msg.sender; }
        address payable owner;

        // This contract only defines a modifier but does not use
        // it: it will be used in derived contracts.
        // The function body is inserted where the special symbol
        // `_;` in the definition of a modifier appears.
        // This means that if the owner calls this function, the
        // function is executed and otherwise, an exception is
        // thrown.
        modifier onlyOwner {
            require(
                msg.sender == owner,
                "Only owner can call this function."
            );
            _;
        }
    }

    contract mortal is owned {
        // This contract inherits the `onlyOwner` modifier from
        // `owned` and applies it to the `close` function, which
        // causes that calls to `close` only have an effect if
        // they are made by the stored owner.
        function close() public onlyOwner {
            selfdestruct(owner);
        }
    }

    contract priced {
        // Modifiers can receive arguments:
        modifier costs(uint price) {
            if (msg.value >= price) {
                _;
            }
        }
    }

    contract Register is priced, owned {
        mapping (address => bool) registeredAddresses;
        uint price;

        constructor(uint initialPrice) public { price = initialPrice; }

        // It is important to also provide the
        // `payable` keyword here, otherwise the function will
        // automatically reject all Ether sent to it.
        function register() public payable costs(price) {
            registeredAddresses[msg.sender] = true;
        }

        function changePrice(uint _price) public onlyOwner {
            price = _price;
        }
    }

    contract Mutex {
        bool locked;
        modifier noReentrancy() {
            require(
                !locked,
                "Reentrant call."
            );
            locked = true;
            _;
            locked = false;
        }

        /// This function is protected by a mutex, which means that
        /// reentrant calls from within `msg.sender.call` cannot call `f` again.
        /// The `return 7` statement assigns 7 to the return value but still
        /// executes the statement `locked = false` in the modifier.
        function f() public noReentrancy returns (uint) {
            (bool success,) = msg.sender.call("");
            require(success);
            return 7;
        }
    }

Multiple modifiers are applied to a function by specifying them in a
whitespace-separated list and are evaluated in the order presented.

.. warning::
    In an earlier version of Solidity, ``return`` statements in functions
    having modifiers behaved differently.

Explicit returns from a modifier or function body only leave the current
modifier or function body. Return variables are assigned and
control flow continues after the "_" in the preceding modifier.

Arbitrary expressions are allowed for modifier arguments and in this context,
all symbols visible from the function are visible in the modifier. Symbols
introduced in the modifier are not visible in the function (as they might
change by overriding).

Function Parameters and Return Variables
========================================

As in JavaScript, functions may take parameters as input. Unlike in JavaScript
and C, functions may also return an arbitrary number of values as output.

Function Parameters
-------------------

Function parameters are declared the same way as variables, and the name of
unused parameters can be omitted.

For example, if you want your contract to accept one kind of external call
with two integers, you would use something like::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    contract Simple {
        uint sum;
        function taker(uint _a, uint _b) public {
            sum = _a + _b;
        }
    }

Function parameters can be used as any other local variable and they can also be assigned to.

.. note::

  An :ref:`external function<external-function-calls>` cannot accept a
  multi-dimensional array as an input
  parameter. This functionality is possible if you enable the new
  experimental ``ABIEncoderV2`` feature by adding ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;`` to your source file.

  An :ref:`internal function<external-function-calls>` can accept a
  multi-dimensional array without enabling the feature.

.. index:: return array, return string, array, string, array of strings, dynamic array, variably sized array, return struct, struct

Return Variables
----------------

Function return variables are declared with the same syntax after the
``returns`` keyword.

For example, suppose you want to return two results: the sum and the product of
two integers passed as function parameters, then you use something like::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    contract Simple {
        function arithmetic(uint _a, uint _b)
            public
            pure
            returns (uint o_sum, uint o_product)
        {
            o_sum = _a + _b;
            o_product = _a * _b;
        }
    }

The names of return variables can be omitted.
Return variables can be used as any other local variable and they
are initialized with their :ref:`default value <default-value>` and have that value unless explicitly set.

You can either explicitly assign to return variables and
then leave the function using ``return;``,
or you can provide return values
(either a single or :ref:`multiple ones<multi-return>`) directly with the ``return``
statement::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    contract Simple {
        function arithmetic(uint _a, uint _b)
            public
            pure
            returns (uint o_sum, uint o_product)
        {
            return (_a + _b, _a * _b);
        }
    }

This form is equivalent to first assigning values to the
return variables and then using ``return;`` to leave the function.

.. note::
    You cannot return some types from non-internal functions, notably
    multi-dimensional dynamic arrays and structs. If you enable the
    new experimental ``ABIEncoderV2`` feature by adding ``pragma experimental
    ABIEncoderV2;`` to your source file then more types are available, but
    ``mapping`` types are still limited to inside a single contract and you
    cannot transfer them.

.. _multi-return:

Returning Multiple Values
-------------------------

When a function has multiple return types, the statement ``return (v0, v1, ..., vn)`` can be used to return multiple values.
The number of components must be the same as the number of return types.

.. index:: ! view function, function;view

.. _view-functions:

View Functions
==============

Functions can be declared ``view`` in which case they promise not to modify the state.

.. note::
  If the compiler's EVM target is Byzantium or newer (default) the opcode
  ``STATICCALL`` is used for ``view`` functions which enforces the state
  to stay unmodified as part of the EVM execution. For library ``view`` functions
  ``DELEGATECALL`` is used, because there is no combined ``DELEGATECALL`` and ``STATICCALL``.
  This means library ``view`` functions do not have run-time checks that prevent state
  modifications. This should not impact security negatively because library code is
  usually known at compile-time and the static checker performs compile-time checks.

The following statements are considered modifying the state:

#. Writing to state variables.
#. :ref:`Emitting events <events>`.
#. :ref:`Creating other contracts <creating-contracts>`.
#. Using ``selfdestruct``.
#. Sending Ether via calls.
#. Calling any function not marked ``view`` or ``pure``.
#. Using low-level calls.
#. Using inline assembly that contains certain opcodes.

::

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

    contract C {
        function f(uint a, uint b) public view returns (uint) {
            return a * (b + 42) + now;
        }
    }

.. note::
  ``constant`` on functions used to be an alias to ``view``, but this was dropped in version 0.5.0.

.. note::
  Getter methods are automatically marked ``view``.

.. note::
  Prior to version 0.5.0, the compiler did not use the ``STATICCALL`` opcode
  for ``view`` functions.
  This enabled state modifications in ``view`` functions through the use of
  invalid explicit type conversions.
  By using  ``STATICCALL`` for ``view`` functions, modifications to the
  state are prevented on the level of the EVM.

.. index:: ! pure function, function;pure

.. _pure-functions:

Pure Functions
==============

Functions can be declared ``pure`` in which case they promise not to read from or modify the state.

.. note::
  If the compiler's EVM target is Byzantium or newer (default) the opcode ``STATICCALL`` is used,
  which does not guarantee that the state is not read, but at least that it is not modified.

In addition to the list of state modifying statements explained above, the following are considered reading from the state:

#. Reading from state variables.
#. Accessing ``address(this).balance`` or ``<address>.balance``.
#. Accessing any of the members of ``block``, ``tx``, ``msg`` (with the exception of ``msg.sig`` and ``msg.data``).
#. Calling any function not marked ``pure``.
#. Using inline assembly that contains certain opcodes.

::

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

    contract C {
        function f(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
            return a * (b + 42);
        }
    }

Pure functions are able to use the `revert()` and `require()` functions to revert
potential state changes when an :ref:`error occurs <assert-and-require>`.

Reverting a state change is not considered a "state modification", as only changes to the
state made previously in code that did not have the ``view`` or ``pure`` restriction
are reverted and that code has the option to catch the ``revert`` and not pass it on.

This behaviour is also in line with the ``STATICCALL`` opcode.

.. warning::
  It is not possible to prevent functions from reading the state at the level
  of the EVM, it is only possible to prevent them from writing to the state
  (i.e. only ``view`` can be enforced at the EVM level, ``pure`` can not).

.. note::
  Prior to version 0.5.0, the compiler did not use the ``STATICCALL`` opcode
  for ``pure`` functions.
  This enabled state modifications in ``pure`` functions through the use of
  invalid explicit type conversions.
  By using  ``STATICCALL`` for ``pure`` functions, modifications to the
  state are prevented on the level of the EVM.

.. note::
  Prior to version 0.4.17 the compiler did not enforce that ``pure`` is not reading the state.
  It is a compile-time type check, which can be circumvented doing invalid explicit conversions
  between contract types, because the compiler can verify that the type of the contract does
  not do state-changing operations, but it cannot check that the contract that will be called
  at runtime is actually of that type.

.. index:: ! fallback function, function;fallback

.. _fallback-function:

Fallback Function
=================

A contract can have exactly one unnamed function. This function cannot have
arguments, cannot return anything and has to have ``external`` visibility.
It is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other
functions match the given function identifier (or if no data was supplied at
all).

Furthermore, this function is executed whenever the contract receives plain
Ether (without data). Additionally, in order to receive Ether, the fallback function
must be marked ``payable``. If no such function exists, the contract cannot receive
Ether through regular transactions.

In the worst case, the fallback function can only rely on 2300 gas being
available (for example when `send` or `transfer` is used), leaving little
room to perform other operations except basic logging. The following operations
will consume more gas than the 2300 gas stipend:

- Writing to storage
- Creating a contract
- Calling an external function which consumes a large amount of gas
- Sending Ether

Like any function, the fallback function can execute complex operations as long as there is enough gas passed on to it.

.. note::
    Even though the fallback function cannot have arguments, one can still use ``msg.data`` to retrieve
    any payload supplied with the call.

.. warning::
    The fallback function is also executed if the caller meant to call
    a function that is not available. If you want to implement the fallback
    function only to receive ether, you should add a check
    like ``require(msg.data.length == 0)`` to prevent invalid calls.

.. warning::
    Contracts that receive Ether directly (without a function call, i.e. using ``send`` or ``transfer``)
    but do not define a fallback function
    throw an exception, sending back the Ether (this was different
    before Solidity v0.4.0). So if you want your contract to receive Ether,
    you have to implement a payable fallback function.

.. warning::
    A contract without a payable fallback function can receive Ether as a recipient of a `coinbase transaction` (aka `miner block reward`)
    or as a destination of a ``selfdestruct``.

    A contract cannot react to such Ether transfers and thus also cannot reject them. This is a design choice of the EVM and Solidity cannot work around it.

    It also means that ``address(this).balance`` can be higher than the sum of some manual accounting implemented in a contract (i.e. having a counter updated in the fallback function).

::

    pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

    contract Test {
        // This function is called for all messages sent to
        // this contract (there is no other function).
        // Sending Ether to this contract will cause an exception,
        // because the fallback function does not have the `payable`
        // modifier.
        function() external { x = 1; }
        uint x;
    }


    // This contract keeps all Ether sent to it with no way
    // to get it back.
    contract Sink {
        function() external payable { }
    }

    contract Caller {
        function callTest(Test test) public returns (bool) {
            (bool success,) = address(test).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("nonExistingFunction()"));
            require(success);
            // results in test.x becoming == 1.

            // address(test) will not allow to call ``send`` directly, since ``test`` has no payable
            // fallback function. It has to be converted to the ``address payable`` type via an
            // intermediate conversion to ``uint160`` to even allow calling ``send`` on it.
            address payable testPayable = address(uint160(address(test)));

            // If someone sends ether to that contract,
            // the transfer will fail, i.e. this returns false here.
            return testPayable.send(2 ether);
        }
    }

.. index:: ! overload

.. _overload-function:

Function Overloading
====================

A contract can have multiple functions of the same name but with different parameter
types.
This process is called "overloading" and also applies to inherited functions.
The following example shows overloading of the function
``f`` in the scope of contract ``A``.

::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    contract A {
        function f(uint _in) public pure returns (uint out) {
            out = _in;
        }

        function f(uint _in, bool _really) public pure returns (uint out) {
            if (_really)
                out = _in;
        }
    }

Overloaded functions are also present in the external interface. It is an error if two
externally visible functions differ by their Solidity types but not by their external types.

::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    // This will not compile
    contract A {
        function f(B _in) public pure returns (B out) {
            out = _in;
        }

        function f(address _in) public pure returns (address out) {
            out = _in;
        }
    }

    contract B {
    }


Both ``f`` function overloads above end up accepting the address type for the ABI although
they are considered different inside Solidity.

Overload resolution and Argument matching
-----------------------------------------

Overloaded functions are selected by matching the function declarations in the current scope
to the arguments supplied in the function call. Functions are selected as overload candidates
if all arguments can be implicitly converted to the expected types. If there is not exactly one
candidate, resolution fails.

.. note::
    Return parameters are not taken into account for overload resolution.

::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    contract A {
        function f(uint8 _in) public pure returns (uint8 out) {
            out = _in;
        }

        function f(uint256 _in) public pure returns (uint256 out) {
            out = _in;
        }
    }

Calling ``f(50)`` would create a type error since ``50`` can be implicitly converted both to ``uint8``
and ``uint256`` types. On another hand ``f(256)`` would resolve to ``f(uint256)`` overload as ``256`` cannot be implicitly
converted to ``uint8``.

.. _libraries:

*********
Libraries
*********

Libraries are similar to contracts, but their purpose is that they are deployed
only once at a specific address and their code is reused using the ``DELEGATECALL``
(``CALLCODE`` until Homestead)
feature of the EVM. This means that if library functions are called, their code
is executed in the context of the calling contract, i.e. ``this`` points to the
calling contract, and especially the storage from the calling contract can be
accessed. As a library is an isolated piece of source code, it can only access
state variables of the calling contract if they are explicitly supplied (it
would have no way to name them, otherwise). Library functions can only be
called directly (i.e. without the use of ``DELEGATECALL``) if they do not modify
the state (i.e. if they are ``view`` or ``pure`` functions),
because libraries are assumed to be stateless. In particular, it is
not possible to destroy a library.

.. note::
    Until version 0.4.20, it was possible to destroy libraries by
    circumventing Solidity's type system. Starting from that version,
    libraries contain a :ref:`mechanism<call-protection>` that
    disallows state-modifying functions
    to be called directly (i.e. without ``DELEGATECALL``).

Libraries can be seen as implicit base contracts of the contracts that use them.
They will not be explicitly visible in the inheritance hierarchy, but calls
to library functions look just like calls to functions of explicit base
contracts (``L.f()`` if ``L`` is the name of the library). Furthermore,
``internal`` functions of libraries are visible in all contracts, just as
if the library were a base contract. Of course, calls to internal functions
use the internal calling convention, which means that all internal types
can be passed and types :ref:`stored in memory <data-location>` will be passed by reference and not copied.
To realize this in the EVM, code of internal library functions
and all functions called from therein will at compile time be pulled into the calling
contract, and a regular ``JUMP`` call will be used instead of a ``DELEGATECALL``.

.. index:: using for, set

The following example illustrates how to use libraries (but manual method
be sure to check out :ref:`using for <using-for>` for a
more advanced example to implement a set).

::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.6.0;

    library Set {
      // We define a new struct datatype that will be used to
      // hold its data in the calling contract.
      struct Data { mapping(uint => bool) flags; }

      // Note that the first parameter is of type "storage
      // reference" and thus only its storage address and not
      // its contents is passed as part of the call.  This is a
      // special feature of library functions.  It is idiomatic
      // to call the first parameter `self`, if the function can
      // be seen as a method of that object.
      function insert(Data storage self, uint value)
          public
          returns (bool)
      {
          if (self.flags[value])
              return false; // already there
          self.flags[value] = true;
          return true;
      }

      function remove(Data storage self, uint value)
          public
          returns (bool)
      {
          if (!self.flags[value])
              return false; // not there
          self.flags[value] = false;
          return true;
      }

      function contains(Data storage self, uint value)
          public
          view
          returns (bool)
      {
          return self.flags[value];
      }
    }

    contract C {
        Set.Data knownValues;

        function register(uint value) public {
            // The library functions can be called without a
            // specific instance of the library, since the
            // "instance" will be the current contract.
            require(Set.insert(knownValues, value));
        }
        // In this contract, we can also directly access knownValues.flags, if we want.
    }

Of course, you do not have to follow this way to use
libraries: they can also be used without defining struct
data types. Functions also work without any storage
reference parameters, and they can have multiple storage reference
parameters and in any position.

The calls to ``Set.contains``, ``Set.insert`` and ``Set.remove``
are all compiled as calls (``DELEGATECALL``) to an external
contract/library. If you use libraries, be aware that an
actual external function call is performed.
``msg.sender``, ``msg.value`` and ``this`` will retain their values
in this call, though (prior to Homestead, because of the use of ``CALLCODE``, ``msg.sender`` and
``msg.value`` changed, though).

The following example shows how to use :ref:`types stored in memory <data-location>` and
internal functions in libraries in order to implement
custom types without the overhead of external function calls:

::

    pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.6.0;

    library BigInt {
        struct bigint {
            uint[] limbs;
        }

        function fromUint(uint x) internal pure returns (bigint memory r) {
            r.limbs = new uint[](1);
            r.limbs[0] = x;
        }

        function add(bigint memory _a, bigint memory _b) internal pure returns (bigint memory r) {
            r.limbs = new uint[](max(_a.limbs.length, _b.limbs.length));
            uint carry = 0;
            for (uint i = 0; i < r.limbs.length; ++i) {
                uint a = limb(_a, i);
                uint b = limb(_b, i);
                r.limbs[i] = a + b + carry;
                if (a + b < a || (a + b == uint(-1) && carry > 0))
                    carry = 1;
                else
                    carry = 0;
            }
            if (carry > 0) {
                // too bad, we have to add a limb
                uint[] memory newLimbs = new uint[](r.limbs.length + 1);
                uint i;
                for (i = 0; i < r.limbs.length; ++i)
                    newLimbs[i] = r.limbs[i];
                newLimbs[i] = carry;
                r.limbs = newLimbs;

As the compiler cannot know where the library will be
deployed at, these addresses have to be filled into the
final bytecode by a linker
(see :ref:`commandline-compiler` for how to use the
commandline compiler for linking). If the addresses are not
given as arguments to the compiler, the compiled hex code
will contain placeholders of the form ``__Set______`` (where
``Set`` is the name of the library). The address can be filled
manually by replacing all those 40 symbols by the hex
encoding of the address of the library contract.

.. note::
    Manually linking libraries on the generated bytecode is discouraged, because
    it is restricted to 36 characters.
    You should ask the compiler to link the libraries at the time
    a contract is compiled by either using
    the ``--libraries`` option of ``solc`` or the ``libraries`` key if you use
    the standard-JSON interface to the compiler.

Restrictions for libraries in comparison to contracts:

- No state variables
- Cannot inherit nor be inherited
- Cannot receive Ether

(These might be lifted at a later point.)

.. _call-protection:

Call Protection For Libraries
=============================

As mentioned in the introduction, if a library's code is executed
using a ``CALL`` instead of a ``DELEGATECALL`` or ``CALLCODE``,
it will revert unless a ``view`` or ``pure`` function is called.

The EVM does not provide a direct way for a contract to detect
whether it was called using ``CALL`` or not, but a contract
can use the ``ADDRESS`` opcode to find out "where" it is
currently running. The generated code compares this address
to the address used at construction time to determine the mode
of calling.

More specifically, the runtime code of a library always starts
with a push instruction, which is a zero of 20 bytes at
compilation time. When the deploy code runs, this constant
is replaced in memory by the current address and this
modified code is stored in the contract. At runtime,
this causes the deploy time address to be the first
constant to be pushed onto the stack and the dispatcher
code compares the current address against this constant
for any non-view and non-pure function.
