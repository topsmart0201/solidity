Welcome to Solidity's documentation!
====================================

See also `Russian version (русский перевод) <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%D0%A0%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D0%BE-Solidity>`_.

Solidity is a high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript
and it is designed to compile to code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
As you will see, it is quite easy to create contracts for voting,
crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

On the next pages, we will first see a :ref:`simple smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written
in Solidity followed by the basics about :ref:`blockchains <blockchain-basics>`
and the :ref:`Ethereum Virtual Machine <the-ethereum-virtual-machine>`.

The next section will explain several *features* of Solidity by giving
useful :ref:`example contracts <voting>`
Remember that you can always try out the contracts
`in your browser <https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity>`_!

The last and most extensive section will cover all aspects of Solidity in depth.

If you still have questions or ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation,
please feel free to come to out `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/>`_.
