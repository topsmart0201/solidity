## Useful links

To get started you can find a basic introduction to the language in [Solidity Tutorial](https://ethereum.github.io/solidity/docs/home/).

You can start using [Solidity in your browser](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/) with no need to download or compile anything. This application only supports compilation - if you want to inject it into the blockchain, you have to use a client like [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) or [AlethZero](https://github.com/ethereum/alethzero).

Also check out more documentations for [Solidity ABI](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity,-Docs-and-ABI) and a crowdfunding [example contract](https://github.com/chriseth/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Crowdfunding-example-contract-in-Solidity) written in Solidity.

[Changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Changelog)

The [Solidity Features](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Features) page contains a list of already completed Solidity feature stories with explanations and demonstrations, it is being updated continuously. More technical information you can find in the [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1189488).

Solidity is still under development. So please do not hesitate and open an [issue in github](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues) if you encounter anything strange.
